<h1 align="center">Machine Learning Models</h1>

"Machine Learning Models" is a final exam project from "Introduction to Machine Learning" course at Singidunum University. The course was designed to teach students how machine learning models work internally and how to code a couple of different types.

For this project, we were tasked to implement Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K-Means, and a simple Neural Network using the Python programming language.
